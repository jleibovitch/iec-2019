# Enspire

## The Problem
The issue that is being looked at is how can life be improved. This can be done in many ways from improving the environment, to helping the economy, or helping one's mental/physical wellness. 

## The Solution
The quality of life can always be improved and we chose to improve not just lives on one person but by improving communities as a whole through an incentive program. The application is called Enspire and it inspires business and local businesses to get the community engaged through tasks that improve the community.
These tasks are distributed by the local businesses and in return, people who participate can receive points which can then be spent at the participating businesses.
The tasks must be benefitial to the community such as cleaning up parks, volunteering for community event, or a food drive.
